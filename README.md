# Metaheuristics Algorithms for Optimization and TSP Problem Solving

Welcome to the Metaheuristique Lab project! This project focuses on implementing metaheuristics algorithms for optimization, specifically for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We utilize algorithms like the Camel Algorithm, Bonobo Algorithm, and Team Game Algorithm.

## Project Link

You can find the project repository on GitHub: [Metaheuristique Lab](https://github.com/AbdelmajidBen/Metaheuristique_Lab)

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Camel Algorithm**: A metaheuristic inspired by the movement patterns of camels.
- **Bonobo Algorithm**: An optimization algorithm inspired by the social behaviors of bonobo apes.
- **Team Game Algorithm**: An algorithm inspired by team dynamics in sports for optimization tasks.

## Problem Solving

The project aims to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using these metaheuristics algorithms. It includes implementations for:

- Simple data sets
- Specifically, the wi76 dataset
